As a developer----

    instruction :-

       once you clone the file in your root directory. open it up in the atom.
       you don't need special dependencies for this project.
       you need to run command npm init in order to run node.
       in terminal type node server.js (you can have different file name).
       this will connect to server.
       you can open bunch of other terminals as well and type telnet localhost 3000 to chat with other terminal.

 test instruction:-

      npm init is first step you will type in command line.
      in order to perform test you will need to run command  ----- npm i -D chai mocha ---------  .
      run npm test in command line. and that is it.
